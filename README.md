This is an [NuShell](https://github.com/nushell/nushell) recreation of [Neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch).

This is supported on Windows and Linux due to [NuShell](https://github.com/nushell/nushell) being cross platform.

## Installation

### Windows

Download the nushell.nu and nushell_config.nu files and put them in your NuShell config folder.

### Linux

Make sure you have [NuShell](https://github.com/nushell/nushell) and [Curl](https://github.com/curl/curl) installed.
